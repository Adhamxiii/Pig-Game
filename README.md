# Pig Game

This project implements a simple two-player dice game known as the Pig Game. Players take turns rolling a dice, accumulating points for each roll. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their current points, and it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach a certain score (typically 100) wins the game.

## Introduction

This project consists of a simple web-based implementation of the Pig Game. It includes features such as rolling the dice, accumulating scores, and switching between players. The game provides a fun and interactive way for two players to compete against each other.

## Game Rules

1. Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided die.
2. The player accumulates points for each roll.
3. If a player rolls a 1, their current points are lost, and it's the next player's turn.
4. The player can choose to "Hold," adding their current points to their total score.
5. The first player to reach a predefined score (e.g., 100) wins the game.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the game structure.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file with the game logic and functionality.
- `dice-*.png`: Images of dice faces used in the game.
